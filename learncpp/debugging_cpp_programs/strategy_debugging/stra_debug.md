## Strategy for debugging

Fortunately, if we canâ€™t find an issue via code inspection, there is another avenue we can take: we can watch the behavior of the program as it runs, and try to diagnose the issue from that. This approach can be generalized as:

- Figure out how to reproduce the problem

- Run the program and gather information to narrow down where the problem is

- Repeat the prior step until you find the problem
